## Introductions

I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Auckland](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/timothy-pistotti), where my research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages. My work aims to develop methods that enable language technologies to function effectively for the vast number of languages that lack large-scale data resources.

My primary interests include cross-lingual transfer learning, computational syntax, and the intersection of linguistics and machine learning.

:::

I recently presented two papers at [BriGap-2](https://brigap-workshop.github.io/), the second workshop on Bridges and Gaps between Formal and Computational Linguistics, held Sept 2025 in DÃ¼sseldorf.

**1. [Evaluating The Impact of Stimulus Quality in Investigations of {LLM} Language Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06018)**

**2. [Exploring Gaps in the APS: Direct Minimal Pair Analysis in LLM Syntactic Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06001)**

<span style="color:lightblue">Thanks to Jason Brown and Michael Witbrok, my Co-Authors on these papers.</span>
