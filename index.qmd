## Introductions

I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Auckland](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/timothy-pistotti), where my research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages. My work aims to develop methods that enable language technologies to function effectively for the vast number of languages that lack large-scale data resources.

My primary interests include cross-lingual transfer learning, computational syntax, and the intersection of linguistics and machine learning.
